I want help (handholding) for getting my own instance of this set up, so that I can hack on it.

I am interested in using nix/nixios automation for this. So I am ideally looking for a candidate that is familiar with this technology, can implement a solution, and help handhold me through the deployment and answer questions I may have about nixos. I am currently very nube, but want to learn more.

However, if I can't find someone with nix/nixos experience, my fallback plan is to just find a decent sysadmin that can get it installed, and then handhold me through any gotchas with doing it myself.
