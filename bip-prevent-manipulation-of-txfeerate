==Abstract==
This BIP describes the new opcode OP_ENERGY, which measures the cost to mine a single satoshi between two blocks. This  can be treated as a price, given in hashes, for energy derivative contracts that can be written and settled on chain. 

For best results, OP_ENERGY should be adopted in conjunction with wip bip "Prevent Manipulation of Transaction Fee rate by Miners."
