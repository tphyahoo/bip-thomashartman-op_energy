==Abstract==
This BIP describes the new opcode OP_ENERGY, which measures the cost to mine a single satoshi between two blocks. This  can be treated as a price, given in hashes, for energy derivative contracts that can be written and settled on chain between untrusting parties, and without requiring an oracle. 

==Prelude==

===Units: Converting from Difficulty to Hashes / Chainwork===

Bitcoin difficulty<ref>https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty</ref> is a measure of how many hashes are expected to be needed, to mine a particular block. 

<pre>
hashes(block) = difficulty(block) * genesis_hashes
  where genesis_hashes = 2**32 
        ** = exponentiation

chainwork(blockN) = hashes(blockGenesis) + hashes(block2) + ... + hashes(blockN)
</pre>

The bitcoin-cli tool sometimes give summary statistics in difficulty units, and sometimes in hashes. OP_ENERGY always uses hashes.

==Summary==

===Calculation of OP_ENERGY===

OP_ENERGY redefines the existing NOP_TBD (to be determined) opcode to give a measure of hashes per satoshi between two blocks. 

To give first some preliminaries, chainwork(blockN) is the total number of hashes that is expected to produce the blockchain ending in blockN. This is a consensus measure that all nodes can access and all nodes agree on.<ref>Bitcoin nodes can look up the chainwork for a block using the bitcoin-cli getblockheader command.</ref>  The average number of hashes, then, expected to be needed to produce blocks from block1 to block2 is chainwork(block2) - chainwork(block1).   

OP_ENERGY is calculated as follows.

<pre>
OP_ENERGY block1 block2 = ( hashes / satoshis ) * ( expectedSeconds / seconds ) 
  where 
      hashes = chainwork (block2) - chainwork (block1) 
          where chainwork (block) = expected number of hashes required to produce the block 
      satoshis = chainRevenue(block2) - chainRevenue(block1)
            where chainRevenue(block) = sum of all miner rewards (approved subsidy + fees) up to this block
      blocks = block2 - block1
      expectedSeconds = 600 * blocks
      seconds = mediantime (block2) - mediantime (block1)
</pre>

Per this formula, higher difficulty makes bitcoin more expensive (in hashes). Higher transaction fees render it cheaper (in hashes). An adjustment factor for hashrate is applied, so an upwards trending hashrate also makes bitcoin more expensive.

The subsidy part of the miner reward is the protocol approved subsidy, which can be computed from the block number. (Actual subsidy differs from this by a few satoshis, presumably due to miner error.<ref>https://medium.com/amberdata/why-the-bitcoin-supply-will-never-reach-21-million-7263e322de1</ref>)

All values are translated into arith_uint256 integers (same as chainwork / bits target), and arithmetic is done accordingly. 

===OP_ENERGY of Genesis Block===

To give a concrete example, OP_ENERGY 1 2 is 6.<ref>https://github.com/tphyahoo/bip-thomashartman-op_energy/blob/master/OP_ENERGY_Whitepaper.mediawiki</ref> The OP_ENERGY measurement at the start of bitcoin was that 6 hashes per satoshi were required.  

The OP_ENERGY whitepaper has further information on historical prices, with interpretation and analysis.

===Script Interpreter Behavior===

If any of the following conditions are true, the script interpreter will terminate with an error:

* the stack has less than 2 elements
* either of the 2 arguments is not type compatible with an nlocktime block number, that is, not in the range from 1 to 500,000,000
* block2 <= block1
* block2 is in the future

Otherwise, the 4 byte arith_uint256 computed value goes on the stack. 

===Penalization of Uneconomic Transactions===

To do



==Motivation==

As Bitcoin lets untrusted parties send value over a communications channel, OP_ENERGY lets untrusted parties trade energy derivatives over a communications channel. Rather than price financial instruments in dollars, or bitcoin, OP_ENERGY prices are given in hashes.

The basic contract is a european cash-or-nothing binary call <ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_option#Cash-or-nothing_call</ref>
on whether some future OP_ENERGY price exceeds some strike. 

Fair prices for OP_ENERGY binaries can be determined using techniques such as black scholes, as is done by market makers on many existing binary exchanges. (Whitepaper: pricing) 

OP_ENERGY settlements are less prone to abuse than binaries on existing centralized binary exchanges, as settlement prices are derived from consensus bitcoin data. 

Synthetic versions of derivatives such as vanilla puts, calls, and futures, can be built up out of the binary call primitive. (whitepaper: compound contracts)

As fiat prices roughly track energy prices, fiat trading volume can thus be moved off custodial exchanges, making markets more efficient, private, and secure.

OP_ENERGY trading is a potentially rich source of miner income, securing bitcoin as miners are weaned off block rewards.

Like any bitcoin transaction, OP_ENERGY trades can be cached onto second layer systems such as lightning. So high frequency trading is feasible, and affordable. OP_ENERGY market makers would be running lightning nodes, earning lightning fees, and presumably also routing non-OP_ENERGY lightning transactions for additional lightning fee income. (whitepaper: HFT)

There may be privacy benefits as well, such as multiparty trades done in mix pools, akin to joinmarket.

Many concrete use cases are given in the whitepaper.

==Intuition==

OP_ENERGY price charts look similar to charts of difficulty and hashrate. However, these are prices of bitcoin in hashes. So miner revenue is also factored in. 

To a lesser but still consequential degree, OP_ENERGY price tracks dollar price. Bcause electricity and mining equipment -- both linked to energy -- are priced in dollars. Modulo hardware efficiency improvements, which will eventually hit diminishing returns, if OP_ENERGY increases by 100x between two block spans, it costs 100x as much energy to mine a bitcoin, hence 100x as many dollars. To be sure, OP_ENERGY price is not perfectly correlated to fiat price (far from it), but there is correlation enough to be useful for hedging. 

(Todo: do r squared regression analysis on OP_ENERGY vs BTCUSD prices, for various lenghts of OP_ENERGY block spans. And make charts of OP_ENERGY price vs usd price, using real data, to support this assertion that OP_ENERGY derivatives would be a useful instrument to hedge BTCUSD.)

==Bitcoin Transactions For Writing and Settling OP_ENERGY Binary Calls==

Writing (Buy/Sell): Alice (the buyer) and Bob (the seller) agree on terms of an OP_ENERGY binary call contract: block span (block1 to block2), strike, premium, and settlement. The settlement value is always 10,000 sat by convention in the examples given here, so that only block span, strike, and and premium need vary.

A sale transaction enforcing these terms is written interactively by Alice  and Bob, who need not trust each other. In broad outline, Alice and Bob create a multisig address interactively. Each deposits bitcoin to the address. Alice's deposit is the premium. Alice + Bob's combined deposit is the settlement .  

The script contains an if clause such that the locked settlement value is spendable by Alice if 

<pre>
strike < OP_ENERGY block1 block2 
</pre>

or Bob otherwise.

Settling (Resolution): The settlement transaction is simply for Alice or Bob to spend the now unlocked funds, after the second block is reached.

==Specification==

Todo: 

* uint256 arithmetic
* binary call sale transaction, on chain
* binary call sale transaction, lightning 
* settlement transactions

<pre>
looks like implementation could start with 

https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/89a8299a14af68c1f96ca1650cbfd4fc2952e77b/src/rpc/mining.cpp
static UniValue GetNetworkHashPS(int lookup, int height) {
  ......
arith_uint256 workDiff = pb->nChainWork - pb0->nChainWork;
    int64_t timeDiff = maxTime - minTime;

    return workDiff.getdouble() / timeDiff;
}

add a coouple functions that do the OP_ENERGY math and I think this would do what we need.
</pre>

==Risks==

See whitepaper<ref>https://github.com/tphyahoo/bip-thomashartman-op_energy/blob/master/OP_ENERGY_Whitepaper.mediawiki</ref>.

==Test Vectors and Reference Code==

Todo.

Initial thoughts for tests... 

* uint256 stuff
* check some empty blocks, in early times when approved subsidy = actual subsidy. The OP_ENERGY should depend on only the computed subsidy, and the mediantimes. 
* actual reward, versus approved subsidy (should be approved subsidy). Check block spans where approved does not equal actual subsidy
* hardcode historical prices from whitepaper, check these in tests
